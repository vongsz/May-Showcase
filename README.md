# Rescue Tracker

**WeReScue Tracker** is a web app/app designed to save lives by enabling real-time GPS location sharing for individuals in emergency situations, such as kidnappings or accidents, in Nigeria. Built as part of my 3MTT Nigeria software development training, this project aims to empower victims to send SOS alerts with their location to trusted contacts or security agencies.

## Features
- **Real-Time Map**: Displays the user’s location using Leaflet.js (centered on Lagos, Nigeria [6.5244, 3.3792]).
- **SOS Alerts**: Notifies contacts with location and timestamp (e.g., "2025-05-25 21:25").
- **Tracker Status**: Shows device ID (#123456), battery level (85%), and last update.
- **Settings (Planned)**: Register trackers and manage contacts for future scalability.

## Purpose
In Nigeria, insecurity delays rescue efforts due to challenges in sharing precise locations. WeReScue Tracker addresses this by providing a user-friendly interface for victims to signal help, with plans to integrate compact GPS trackers like Oluwatobi Oyinlola’s record-breaking device (22.93 x 11.92 mm) for discreet, wearable SOS functionality.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Map**: Leaflet.js (v1.9.4, CDN-hosted)

## Current Progress
- **Completed**: Responsive front-end with interactive map, SOS alerts, and tracker status display.
- **In Progress**: Learning JavaScript for dynamic GPS updates.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Integrate Oluwatobi Oyinlola’s GPS tracker for real-time SOS.
  - Add backend for user accounts and alert notifications.
  - Develop mobile app version for wider accessibility.

## Collaboration
I’m seeking partners to scale WeReScue Tracker:
- **GPS Experts**: To integrate compact trackers (e.g., Oluwatobi Oyinlola’s).
- **Investors**: To fund backend and hardware development.
- **Security Agencies**: To deploy for rapid response.
